        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
        <br>
        And sorry I could not travel both
        <br>
        And be one traveler,long I stood
        <br>
        And looked down one as far as I could
        <br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;
        <br>
        <br>
        Then took the other,as just as fair,
        <br>
        And having perhaps the better claim,
        <br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
        <br>
        Though as for that the passing there
        <br>
        Had worn them really about the same,
        <br>

        'The Starlight Night' was
            one of the two poems which Hopkins
            sent to his mother as a birthday present,

        the other poem being 'God's Grandeur'.
                 what a birthday present!
